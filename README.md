1996 Harp : A Fantasy Adventure Book Turbo Pascal 5.5 source

This is a Turbo Pascal 5.5 source (.pas file and final-game-data) for the 1996 retro indie adventure game released in IBM-PC DOS in South Korea.

To compile and run this you'll need:
1x IBM-PC XT or AT (I'm sure 386 or 486, maybe Pentium system will work too)
1x Hercules monochrome graphic card with monochrome monitor (720 x 348 b/w mode support, green monitor would better)
1x any MS-DOS (or PC-DOS or DR- or any Disk Operating System) that can run Turbo Pascal 5.5

more 21st Century-style alternative:
1x any system that can run DOSBOX (set to monochrome mode!)

and you will defenately need:
1x Turbo Pascal 5.5 package (must!)
