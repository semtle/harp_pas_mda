1996 Harp : A Fantasy Adventure Book Turbo Pascal 5.5 source

This is a Turbo Pascal 5.5 source (.pas file and final-game-data) for the 1996 retro indie adventure game released in IBM-PC DOS in South Korea.

To compile and run this you'll need:
- IBM-PC XT or AT (I'm sure 386 or 486, maybe Pentium system will work too)
- Hercules monochrome graphic card with monochrome monitor (720 x 348 b/w mode support, green monitor would better)
- any MS-DOS (or PC-DOS or DR- or any Disk Operating System) that can run Turbo Pascal 5.5


more 21st Century-style alternative:
- any system that can run DOSBox (set to monochrome mode!)

and you will definately need:
- Turbo Pascal 5.5 package
